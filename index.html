              <h2 class="pb-2">Crime in Gainesville</h2>
    <p>This chart shows that instances of police responding to crime in Gainesville has decreased consistently in the last several years. Meanwhile, arrests have also decreased, but not as dramatically as crime responses. Some might point to that as proof that crime overall has dropped in Gainesville. However, the data is incomplete as it does not contain the number of total crimes reported to the Gainesville Police Department, and even if it did contain that information it would not account for unreported crimes. The data also lacks information on whether the number of police responses has decreased because GPD has had fewer police on the force recently. According to GPD's <a href="http://www.gainesvillepd.org/Portals/0/files/PIO/2019%20GPD%20Annual%20Report.pdf?ver=2020-06-19-102529-480">2019 annual report</a>, the number of officers on GPD's police force dropped slightly
      from <a href="http://www.gainesvillepd.org/Portals/0/files/PIO/2018%20GPD%20Annual%20Report.pdf?ver=2020-06-08-114843-530">2018</a>-2019. Additionally, GPD assistant police chief Lonnie Scott also said that recruiting has been challenging as the department is getting fewer applications from recruits as the years pass in <a href="https://followingupblm.alligator.org/">an interview</a> over the summer.</p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above charts seem to show a decrease in crimes overall in Gainesville. Crime decreased in all crime types, but a significantly big drop came in the categories of sexual assault, burglaries, larceny/theft and overall drug charges. However, the data leaves us with more questions than answers as it's not clear why the decrease happened. It could be due to a number of factors, such as, a decreasing police force, changes in how crimes are categorized or a drop in crimes being reported. That will have to be answered with more data.</p>

      <p>The following chart shows how Gainesville has one of the highest utility bill averages in Florida. In 2019, nearby towns of Starke and Newberry saw a significant dip in their rates, but Gainesville rose higher than average Although Starke and Newberry have smaller populations and less demand for utilities, Gainesville is higher than both Tallahassee and Jacksonville.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 pb-3">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While Gainesville utility rates have remained some of the highest in the region and the state, revenue seems to be average when the data is normalized for population compared to other utility providers around the state. In fact, Gainesville Regional Utilities had less revenue than Kissimmee Utility Authority despite GRU serving about 10,000 more customers than KUA. Based on the information, it seems that while GRU rates are some of the highest in the state, it's revenue is not higher because of those rates, which leaves questions about what GRU spends its money on.</p>

        <p>The chart below shows no particular trend in building permits over the last five years except for how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the issuance of permits. After experiencing a drop in 2017, the number of building permits issued in Gainesville was consistently increasing every year after until 2020, when the number was at its lowest in years. However, 2021 saw that number nearly double making up for any losses during the pandemic.</p>

    <p>The second chart shows the breakdown of permit types for new construction, and it shows how new construction helped boost the number of permits in 2016. However, new residential dwellings have consistently made up a majority of new construction permits over the years, beating both new apartments and new commercial buildings by far.</p>

          <p>The chart below shows some of the vendors receiving a big portion of the Gainesville government's local budget. The most notable thing to note about the data is how much Gainesville spends on paying Gainesville Regional Utilities, its own utility company. According to the data under the Gainesville Utilities section of this website, GRU charges some of the highest average costs in the region, which might explain the $4 million tab reserved for the city's budget paid for in 2020. Next to GRU, Amazon also had some of the highest number of purchases from the city, which added up to over $100,00 in sales for Amazon.</p>
